       "Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system. It is smaller than the four gas giants â€” Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball. But, it's not perfectly round."]
